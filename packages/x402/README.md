# @priors/x402

x402 on Robinhood Chain (`eip155:4663`) in USDG, on top of the official `@x402/*` 2.27 packages, plus credit:
when an agent is short, it can borrow the gap from its [Priors](https://priors.trade) line.

- `registerUsdg(scheme)`: `price: "$0.05"` on `eip155:4663` means USDG (6 decimals, EIP-712 domain "Global Dollar" v1).
- `priorsFacilitator({ apiKey })`: config for the official `HTTPFacilitatorClient`, pointed at
  `https://facilitator.priors.trade`, with your merchant key as `Authorization: Bearer …` on verify/settle/supported.
- `createPayer({ signer, … }).pay(url, init)`: a fetch that pays x402 USDG (v2, and legacy v1 `robinhood` bodies)
  and borrows the gap when you allow it.
- `robinhood`: the constants (network and its legacy v1 name, chain id, USDG address and decimals, EIP-712 domain,
  facilitator URL, public RPC URL, Priors pool, lens, identity registry and stock vault addresses).

```sh
npm i @priors/x402 @x402/core @x402/evm ethers
```

The examples below also use optional packages: `@x402/express` (Express), `@x402/hono` (Hono), and `@x402/mcp` with
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (the paid MCP tool). Install the ones you use.

## Merchant: Express

```js
import express from "express";
import { paymentMiddleware, x402ResourceServer } from "@x402/express";
import { ExactEvmScheme } from "@x402/evm/exact/server";
import { HTTPFacilitatorClient } from "@x402/core/server";
import { registerUsdg, priorsFacilitator, robinhood } from "@priors/x402";

const server = new x402ResourceServer(new HTTPFacilitatorClient(priorsFacilitator({ apiKey: process.env.PRIORS_MERCHANT_KEY })))
  .register(robinhood.network, registerUsdg(new ExactEvmScheme()));

const app = express();
app.use(paymentMiddleware({
  "GET /report": {
    accepts: { scheme: "exact", price: "$0.05", network: robinhood.network, payTo: "0xYourAddress" },
    description: "One report, 0.05 USDG",
  },
}, server));
app.get("/report", (req, res) => res.json({ report: "…" }));
app.listen(3000);
```

The merchant key comes from registering your `payTo` with the facilitator (`POST /merchants/register`, or the
merchant page of x402.priors.trade). `createResourceServer({ apiKey })` does the first two lines in one call.

## Merchant: Hono

```js
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { paymentMiddleware } from "@x402/hono";
import { createResourceServer, robinhood } from "@priors/x402";

const app = new Hono();
app.use(paymentMiddleware({
  "GET /report": {
    accepts: { scheme: "exact", price: "$0.05", network: robinhood.network, payTo: "0xYourAddress" },
    description: "One report, 0.05 USDG",
  },
}, createResourceServer({ apiKey: process.env.PRIORS_MERCHANT_KEY })));
app.get("/report", (c) => c.json({ report: "…" }));
export default app;
```

## Merchant: a paid MCP tool (`@x402/mcp`)

```js
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { createPaymentWrapper } from "@x402/mcp";
import { createResourceServer, robinhood } from "@priors/x402";

const resourceServer = createResourceServer({ apiKey: process.env.PRIORS_MERCHANT_KEY });
await resourceServer.initialize();
const accepts = await resourceServer.buildPaymentRequirements({
  scheme: "exact", network: robinhood.network, payTo: "0xYourAddress", price: "$0.01",
});
const paid = createPaymentWrapper(resourceServer, { accepts });

const mcp = new McpServer({ name: "my-paid-tools", version: "1.0.0" });
mcp.tool("quote", "A price quote. Costs 0.01 USDG.", {}, paid(async () => ({ content: [{ type: "text", text: "42" }] })));
await mcp.connect(new StdioServerTransport());
```

An agent pays it with `@x402/mcp`'s client and this package's USDG client:
`wrapMCPClientWithPayment(mcpClient, createUsdgClient({ signer, maxPrice: "$0.05" }), { autoPayment: true })`.

## Merchant: check who is paying (record gate)

The payer's Priors record is what it has borrowed and repaid on Robinhood Chain, and whether it ever defaulted.
`recordGate` reads it before the facilitator sees the payment. A payment the merchant's policy refuses is never
verified or settled: no money moves, and the client gets the usual 402 with the reason (`priors_payer_defaulted`,
`priors_record_too_short`, `priors_score_too_low`, `priors_price_not_entitled`, `priors_record_unavailable`).

```js
import { createResourceServer, recordGate } from "@priors/x402";

const server = createResourceServer({ apiKey: process.env.PRIORS_FACILITATOR_KEY });
recordGate({ refuseDefaulted: true, minRepaid: 1 }).attach(server); // then paymentMiddleware(routes, server) as above
```

| option | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `refuseDefaulted` | `true` | refuse a payer whose agent defaulted on a Priors loan |
| `minRepaid` | `0` | repaid Priors loans the payer must have |
| `minScore` | none | Priors Score v2 the payer must have (on-chain score with `source: "chain"`) |
| `source` | `"api"` | `"api"`: `https://priors.trade/api/check` by the payer's address (every agent it owns or declared as its payment wallet; no key). `"chain"`: Priors pool v2 read over `rpc`, for the agent the payer names in the `X-Priors-Agent` header, after checking the paying address controls it; a payer the pool marked for a default (or the named agent's owner, if marked) counts as defaulted whatever agent it names, or none. Use it on a fork, or to depend on no Priors service |
| `rpc`, `pool` | public RPC, the published pool | for `source: "chain"` |
| `tiers`, `basePrice` | none | prices by record: `tiers: [{ minRepaid: 3, price: "$0.01" }]`, `basePrice: "$0.02"` |
| `cacheSeconds` | `60` | how long a payer's record is reused |
| `onDecision` | none | called with `{ payer, record, ok, reason }` for each payment |

A record that cannot be read refuses rather than serves on a guess.

**Prices by record.** Give the route `price: gate.tierPrice()`. A client states its address in `X-Payer` (and its
agent in `X-Priors-Agent` with `source: "chain"`) to be quoted its tier. That statement is only a request: when the
payment arrives, the gate reads the record of the address that actually signed it. It refuses a payment below that
payer's own price, so claiming someone else's record gets nothing.

```js
const gate = recordGate({ basePrice: "$0.02", tiers: [{ minRepaid: 3, price: "$0.01" }] });
gate.attach(server); // attach returns the server; tierPrice is on the gate
// routes: { "GET /report": { accepts: { scheme: "exact", price: gate.tierPrice(), network: "eip155:4663", payTo } } }
```

## Agent: pay, and borrow the gap

```js
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { createPayer, robinhood } from "@priors/x402";

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(robinhood.rpcUrl);
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.AGENT_KEY, provider); // the agent's wallet (and its Priors controller)

const payer = createPayer({
  signer,
  maxPrice: "$0.10",          // most one call may cost; a dearer 402 is refused before anything is signed
  // optional credit: borrow what the wallet is short of, from the agent's Priors line
  pool: robinhood.pool, agentId: 1234, maxBorrow: "$5",
});

const { response, paid, borrowed, loanId, dueAt } = await payer.pay("https://api.example.com/report");
console.log(response.status, await response.json(), { paid, borrowed, loanId, dueAt });
// once the agent has been paid by its client:
const { open } = await payer.settleLoans(); // repays open loans, earliest due first, as far as the wallet covers; before dueAt. `open` lists what it could not pay
```

Amounts: a `bigint` or integer is atomic USDG (6 decimals: `100000n` = $0.10); a string with `$` is dollars.

A result also carries the `requirement` it paid, its `x402Version` and, on success, the decoded `settlement`
(`PAYMENT-RESPONSE`) when the merchant sent one. Other `createPayer` options: `maxValiditySeconds` (at most 600, the
default), `asset` (a USDG address for a fork or test token; default the pool's `usdg()`, else mainnet USDG),
`fetchImpl`, `pendingRetries` (default 6), `maxSleepMs` (longest wait between resends, default 30 s) and `sleep`.

### What `pay()` promises (the rules of `sdk/float.mjs`, unchanged)

- **`maxPrice`** (default $0.10) is checked before anything is read, signed or borrowed.
- **Borrowing** happens only when the wallet is short, a `pool` and `agentId` are given, and the price is within
  `maxBorrow` (default 0: never), and only for a requirement x402 core will sign: a `paymentFlow` core does not know is
  skipped for a later requirement, and core's own selection takes the one picked before the balance is read, topped up
  or borrowed against (`NO_USDG_REQUIREMENT` otherwise). It draws `max(shortfall, pool minimum loan)`, refuses above
  `maxBorrow` or the pool's `maxLoan`, caps the fee at the pool's quote (or `maxFee`), and simulates the borrow first. A borrow that was
  sent and whose answer was lost (the broadcast's or the receipt's) may have mined: it throws `BORROW_UNCONFIRMED` with
  `borrowed` set, `loanId: null`, `unconfirmed: true` and the tx `hash` when known. Count it, check the agent's loans,
  and repay before the due date.
- **Term**: 7 days by default, clamped into the pool's range; an explicit `termSeconds` above the pool's maximum is
  refused. The result's `dueAt` is when the loan is due; three days later anyone can mark it defaulted, and the
  agent's record is burnt.
- **Authorization window**: at most 600 s, whatever `maxTimeoutSeconds` the merchant asks. The payload's `accepted`
  stays the merchant's requirement verbatim.
- **One signature per purchase.** While the merchant answers "pending" (v2 `settlement_pending`, or a legacy
  `{pending:true}` body) the same signed payment is resent, up to 6 times, honouring `Retry-After`. If it is still
  pending, the result is `{ pending: true, paymentHeaders }`: call `payer.resend(url, paymentHeaders)` later, and do
  not call `pay()` again for the same purchase. A payer also remembers its unsettled payments: a later `pay()` for the
  same purchase (the method; the URL as the merchant reads it: without its fragment, query fields in name order, `+`
  and `%20` alike, escapes in one case; and the body: a JSON body by its value, so key order, whitespace and how a
  number is written do not count, and a urlencoded or multipart form by its fields; `purchaseKey(request)` gives it)
  resends that one (`resent: true`) until it expires, plus `SKEW_SECONDS` (60 s, exported) for a chain clock behind
  this machine's. That memory is per payer and per process: pass `onSigned(s)` to `createPayer` to record each payment
  before it leaves (`s.paymentHeaders`, `s.validBefore`, `s.price`, `s.purchase`), so a new process can resend it
  instead of signing again. If `onSigned` throws, the payment is not sent: `pay()` rejects with `NOT_RECORDED` and
  nothing can be settled. `@priors/mcp` does this with a state file.
- **Legacy v1** 402 bodies (`network: "robinhood"`, `X-PAYMENT`) are paid the way `sdk/float.mjs` pays them.
- **No redirects.** Requests go out with `redirect: "manual"` unless you pass another `redirect` in `init` (`redirect:
  undefined` counts as none): a signed payment never travels to a host you did not name, and a 3xx comes back as the
  answer.
- **Bounded.** Bodies are read up to 256 KB (`readCapped`). `timeoutMs` (60 s by default; 0 = none) bounds each request, `signal` every
  call and `init.signal` (as `fetch` takes it) the one call: once either has fired, nothing more is read, topped up,
  borrowed or signed, and `pay()` rejects with the abort. A timeout or an abort once the payment is out returns `{ pending: true, timedOut: true, paymentHeaders }`, and a dropped
  connection `{ pending: true, transportError: true, error, paymentHeaders }`: never an error once the payment may be
  out. An error thrown after a loan or a signature carries `borrowed`, `loanId`, `dueAt` and `signed`.
- **One payment at a time** per payer: two concurrent `pay()` calls on a short wallet do not both borrow the gap.
- **`signed`**: every result of a signed payment carries `signed: { paymentHeaders, validBefore }`. Until
  `validBefore` the merchant can still cash it, so a retry of the same purchase must `resend` these headers.

Refusals throw a `PayError` with a `code`: `PRICE_ABOVE_MAX_PRICE`, `PRICE_ABOVE_MAX_BORROW`,
`MIN_LOAN_ABOVE_MAX_BORROW`, `ABOVE_MAX_LOAN`, `TERM_OUT_OF_RANGE`, `FEE_TOO_HIGH`, `NO_POOL`, `NO_USDG_REQUIREMENT`
(no requirement this payer signs: USDG on Robinhood Chain, or USDC on Base when enabled), `BAD_402`,
`BORROW_WOULD_REVERT`, `BORROW_UNCONFIRMED` (not a refusal: the borrow was sent, and may have opened a loan),
`NO_SIGNER`, `NO_PROVIDER` (also: `networks` names Base and no `baseProvider` was given), `NO_FETCH`,
`UNSUPPORTED_TRANSFER_METHOD` (a requirement that is not EIP-3009), `BAD_NETWORK` (a `networks` entry not in the
allowlist), `BASE_FLOAT_SHORT` (a Base requirement, and the wallet's USDC on Base, less what `baseReserve()` keeps
back, is short of the price: nothing was signed; `price`, `balance`, `reserve`, `network` and `asset` on the error),
`NOT_CONTROLLER` (`repayLoan`, `settleLoans`), `NOT_OWNERS_LOAN` (`repayLoan`, 0.6.3). The
bridge (below) adds its own codes. The credit helpers add
`LOAN_SIZE_OUT_OF_RANGE` (`quoteBorrow`, `borrowLine`), `LOAN_NOT_ACTIVE`, `INSUFFICIENT_USDG`, `REPAY_WOULD_REVERT`
(`repayLoan`) and `NO_STOCK_VAULT` (`stockPosition`, `stockAssets`).

### Why `pay()` is not just `@x402/fetch`'s `wrapFetchWithPayment`

It uses the same parts (`x402Client`, `x402HTTPClient`, `ExactEvmScheme`), but writes the request loop out, because
the wrapper (2.27) cannot keep the rules above: it can only act inside payload creation, so a borrow refusal would
surface as a generic "Failed to create payment payload" error; when a response hook reports `recovered` it signs a
fresh payload while the first may still settle (two payments for one call); it has no pending loop and never hands
back the signed header; and it cannot route v1 `robinhood` bodies. If you never borrow, `createUsdgClient()` gives you
an `x402Client` with the same USDG allowance, price cap and 600 s window for `wrapFetchWithPayment`:

```js
import { wrapFetchWithPayment } from "@x402/fetch";
import { createUsdgClient } from "@priors/x402";
const fetchWithPay = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, createUsdgClient({ signer, maxPrice: "$0.10" }));
```

## Credit helpers

`@priors/x402/credit` has the Priors v2 pieces the MCP server uses: `creditContracts`, `creditStatus`, `quoteBorrow`,
`borrowLine`, `repayLoan`, `settleLoans`, `balances`, `borrowGap`, plus `poolContract`, `explainRevert` (a revert as
`Name(args)`), `LOAN_STATUS` and the ABIs (`POOL_ABI`, `LENS_ABI`, `ERC20_ABI`, `STOCK_VAULT_ABI`). `repayLoan` pays
only a loan of an agent the signer controls (owner or pool delegate); any other loan is refused with `NOT_CONTROLLER`
before anything is sent. From 0.6.3 it also pays only a loan the agent's owner now took: a loan opened while someone
else held the agent (`Loan.owner` is another address) is refused with `NOT_OWNERS_LOAN`, and `settleLoans` leaves such
loans in `open` and lists them in `others` with who opened them (GHSA-mmp8).

Stock lines (the Priors stock vault, `robinhood.stockVault`, backs a line with the agent's own stock tokens;
`creditContracts` reads it unless `addresses.stockVault` says otherwise): `creditStatus` carries `collateral` {
`token`, `amount`, `value` (what the vault prices them at, null while it will not), `ltvBps`, `borrowRoom`, `hold`
(0, or why new loans wait: `STOCK_HOLDS`), `holdReason`, `status`, `closing` } for a stock line (null for any other),
and its `available` is the smaller of the pool's figure and `borrowRoom` (`stockCollateral(c, id, sponsor)` reads that
object on its own). `stockPosition(c, id, assets?)` and
`stockAssets(c, assets)` read one position and the accepted tokens (price, whether the vault lends now, LTV).

## Savings (`@priors/x402/savings`)

An agent's spare USDG in a Morpho vault (Morpho Vault V2, ERC-4626; Steakhouse USDG by default), taken back out when
it has to pay or repay:

```js
import { savingsContracts, savingsOf, save, unsave, topUpFromSavings } from "@priors/x402/savings";
const c = await savingsContracts({ runner: provider });            // refused unless there is a contract whose asset is USDG
await save(c, signer, 20_000_000n);                                 // 20 USDG in (checks the deposit gate first)
const s = await savingsOf(c, signer.address);                       // { saved, withdrawable, reachable, wallet, shares, ... }
await unsave(c, signer, { all: true });

// pay and repay from savings before borrowing
const payer = createPayer({ signer, pool: robinhood.pool, agentId, maxBorrow: "$1", topUp: (need) => topUpFromSavings(c, signer, need) });
const r = await payer.pay(url);          // r.savings: what the top-up did
const { open } = await payer.settleLoans();  // tops up to what all open loans need first; check `open`
```

- `withdrawable` is what a plain withdrawal pays now (idle, then the vault's liquidity market), found by simulating it
  (Morpho Vault V2 answers 0 to `maxWithdraw` by design). `reachable` adds the in-kind exit: `unsave` and
  `topUpFromSavings` move money out of the vault's other penalty-free markets and withdraw it in one transaction
  (`forceDeallocate` + `withdraw` in `multicall`) when the plain path falls short.
- Every vault transaction is sent with a gas margin. Refused before any transaction: `SHORT`, `ZERO`,
  `NOTHING_SAVED`, `MORE_THAN_SAVED` (each deposit is worth one base unit less than paid in), `VAULT_ILLIQUID` (with
  `withdrawable` and `reachable`), `EXIT_FAILED`, `EXIT_BLOCKED`, `DEPOSITS_CLOSED`, `NO_GAS`, `BAD_VAULT`,
  `NOT_USDG`. `VAULT_FULL` comes after the approval, which is then put back (`allowanceReset`). After sending:
  `REVERTED` (on chain) and `UNCONFIRMED` (sent, confirmation not read; check before retrying), both with the `hash`.
  A node failure is thrown as is.
- The in-kind exit uses only markets other than the liquidity market, with a penalty of 0, charged to an address that
  holds nothing: a penalty switched on before the transaction lands makes it revert rather than cost the saver.
- Every function takes an optional `{ signal, sent }`: the signal stops it before it sends a transaction, and `sent`
  is the hash once one is sent. A `topUp` whose error has `pending: true` (or code `UNCONFIRMED`) makes `pay` stop
  with `SAVINGS_PENDING` before any loan or signature.
- The money is the agent's own and the vault's risks are the agent's; Priors never holds it.

## Autopay (`@priors/x402/autopay`)

The agent's own wallet repays its loans on time through AutoRepay v2:
it approves a budget and enrolls once, and Priors' keeper (or anyone) repays each loan in the 6 hours before it is due,
from that wallet, while it holds enough. AutoRepay has no owner and no upgrade; it sends the wallet's USDG only to the
pool, for the agent's own loans. A plan lasts while the agent keeps the owner and the wallet it was set under: after a
new key or a sale, `autopayStatus` says `stale` and `autopayOn` is needed again. From 0.5.0 `autopayOn` refuses
AutoRepay v1 (retired before use) with `AUTOREPAY_V1`.

```js
import { autopayContracts, autopayOn, autopayStatus, autopayOff, defaultCap } from "@priors/x402/autopay";
const c = autopayContracts({ runner: provider, address: AUTOREPAY, registry, usdg, savingsVault, pool });
await autopayOn(c, wallet, agentId, { cap: defaultCap(line) }); // approves 4 x cap, then enroll(agentId, cap, false, true)
const st = await autopayStatus(c, wallet.address, agentId);     // plan, budget, next loan and its window, shortfall
```

- `createPayer({ reserve })`: a payment that would cut into what `reserve()` returns (e.g. `autopayReserve(status)`,
  what loans whose window opens in the next 24 h pull) is refused with `RESERVE` before anything is signed or borrowed.
- `settleLoans({ onlyInWindow: true })` (and `payer.settleLoans({ onlyInWindow: true })`): repay only the loans whose
  window (`repayWindow`, AutoRepay's own rule, never in a loan's first hour) is open, or that are past due; the others
  come back in `waiting`.

## SeatVaultV5 lines (`@priors/x402/credit`)

A line backed by SeatVaultV5 has no room until it is refreshed: V5 vouches nothing at the open and raises the pool's
vouch only on `refresh`, by the agent's owner or by the agent's pool delegate that V5 recorded (`noteDelegate`) at least
24 hours before. With `createPayer({ v5, v5Root })` (and `creditContracts({ addresses: { seatVaultV5,
seatVaultV5AgentId } })` for `borrowLine`), a borrow on such a line first calls `v5BeforeBorrow`: the owner, or a key
V5 recorded a day ago, refreshes the line; a key V5 has not recorded is recorded now, and while its 24 hours run the
borrow goes ahead only within the line's room, else it stops with `V5_DELEGATE_WAIT`, saying when it can borrow (the
owner can borrow from Go mode meanwhile, which refreshes first).

## Paying USDC sellers on Base (`networks`, `@priors/x402/bridge`)

From 0.6.0, and off unless you ask for it. Many x402 sellers take USDC on Base only. A payer can pay them from a small USDC balance the
agent keeps on Base, its Base float, while the loan and its repayment stay in USDG on Robinhood Chain.

```js
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { createPayer, BASE_USDC } from "@priors/x402";
import { fundBase, returnToRobinhood } from "@priors/x402/bridge";
const base = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(BASE_USDC.rpcUrl);
const payer = createPayer({ signer, networks: ["eip155:4663", "eip155:8453"], baseProvider: base, maxPrice: "$0.10" });
await fundBase({ signer, amount: 5_000_000n });          // 5 USDG on Robinhood Chain -> about 4.99 USDC on Base (Across)
await payer.pay("https://pro-api.coingecko.com/api/v3/x402/onchain/search/pools"); // a seller paid in USDC on Base
await returnToRobinhood({ signer, amount: 1_000_000n, baseProvider: base }); // USDC back to USDG (Relay, no gas on Base)
```

- **The allowlist** (`NETWORKS`, frozen): USDG on `eip155:4663` ("Global Dollar"/"1") and USDC on `eip155:8453`
  (`0x833589fC…2913`, "USD Coin"/"2"), matched by full address only. `pickV2Requirement(accepts, asset, { networks })`
  refuses any other token, a lookalike (two "USDG" tokens on Robinhood Chain copy USDG's address prefix and suffix),
  and any EIP-712 domain but the token's own; a seller that takes both is paid on Robinhood Chain. Legacy v1 bodies stay
  Robinhood Chain only. `createUsdgClient({ networks })` registers Base only when it is named.
- **Paying on Base** reads the wallet's USDC through `baseProvider` and never borrows, tops up from savings or reads the
  Autopay reserve (those are Robinhood Chain's): a float short of the price is `BASE_FLOAT_SHORT`, before anything is
  signed. `baseReserve: () => bigint` names what the float keeps back (read before the balance; `@priors/mcp` keeps
  back a `returnToRobinhood` whose authorization can still be used): the price must fit in the rest. `onSigned` and
  the result carry `network` and `asset`.
- **`fundBase({ signer, amount, maxFeeBps?, timeoutMs?, onDepositSending? })`**: Across. The quote
  (`acrossQuote`, `checkAcrossQuote`) is refused unless its tokens, chains and both spokes are the pinned ones
  (`ACROSS`), the amount is above Across's minimum, the quote is fresh enough for the spoke and the fee is within
  `maxFeeBps` (default 100). Then an approval of exactly the amount (only when the allowance is short), a simulated
  `depositV3` to the signer's own address on Base with the quote's `outputAmount` exactly, `onDepositSending` awaited
  before the broadcast, and Across's deposit status polled until it is filled. Needs ETH for gas on Robinhood Chain.
- **`returnToRobinhood({ signer, amount, baseProvider?, maxFeeBps? })`**: Relay's gasless route. Relay's quote carries
  an EIP-712 `ReceiveWithAuthorization`; it is never signed as returned. `checkRelayReturn` checks every field (USDC's
  domain on Base, from the signer, to Relay's pinned proxy `RELAY.receiver`, the exact value, valid from now for at
  most 15 minutes, a 32-byte nonce, USDG on Robinhood Chain by full address as the output, the signer as recipient,
  the fee) and the message signed is rebuilt from those values. It never goes through `CappedExactEvmScheme`.
  `submitRelayPermit` hands it to Relay as Relay's own SDK does; that call is **unverified against the live API**
  until the first real return.
- **Errors** (`PayError`, `moved` says whether money may have left): before anything is sent, `BRIDGE_QUOTE_FAILED`,
  `BRIDGE_QUOTE_REFUSED`, `BRIDGE_FEE_TOO_HIGH`, `INSUFFICIENT_USDG`, `BRIDGE_WOULD_REVERT`, `BRIDGE_REVERTED`,
  `NO_GAS`, `NOT_RECORDED`, `RELAY_QUOTE_FAILED`, `RELAY_QUOTE_REFUSED`, `INSUFFICIENT_USDC`; once it may be out,
  `DEPOSIT_UNCONFIRMED` (the deposit's answer was lost), `BRIDGE_PENDING` (not filled in the time: it may still land,
  or Across refunds it on Robinhood Chain after its fill deadline), `BRIDGE_REFUNDED`, `RETURN_PENDING` and
  `RETURN_FAILED` (the authorization is out until it expires). Never send a transfer again while one may be out.

## Tests

`npm run test:packages` in the Priors repository: unit tests with mocks, and, with `RPC_URL` set, an anvil fork of
chain 4663 where a standard `@x402/express` server priced with `registerUsdg` is paid by `createPayer`.
`scripts/test-x402-base.mjs` (also part of `npm test`) covers the Base path and the bridge; with `--fork`,
`BASE_RPC_URL` settles a seller's USDC 402 on a Base fork, and `RPC_URL` deposits into the real Across spoke on a
Robinhood Chain fork.
