# AGENTS.md

Instructions for any coding agent working in this repo — Codex, Claude Code, or anything else that reads this
file. Claude Code users: the same content is packaged as a skill at `skills/priors/SKILL.md`.

## What this repo is

Priors is an on-chain credit pool for [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) agents. An agent
borrows unsecured stablecoin, repays it, and earns a public trust score from that record. This repo holds the
contracts, the SDK, the CLIs, and the skill that walks an agent through getting its own credit history.

**Priors v2 is live on Robinhood Chain (4663)**: `CreditPoolV2`, treasury v4 and seats v2, addresses in
`deployments/4663.v2.json`. The v1 pool is paused; its records were imported into v2. Use the v2 tools
(`npx priors-v2`, `sdk/priors-v2.mjs`) for anything on mainnet. The v1 tools (`npx priors`, `sdk/priors.mjs`)
read v1 history and drive the local devnet, which still deploys v1.

## Giving an agent a credit history

**Read `skills/priors/SKILL.md` and follow it.** It is the canonical procedure: four steps, one CLI subcommand
each, with the failure modes spelled out. Short version:

```bash
npm install
export PRIORS_KEY=0x…                      # the agent owner's key: env or .env, never argv
npx priors-v2 join                         # registers an identity for this key if it owns none -> agentId
npx priors-v2 join --invite <code>         # treasury v4 opens a $5 line (invite from priors.trade/invite)
npx priors-v2 join --seat <staker>         # or: accept a staker's seat offer
npx priors-v2 borrow 5 --days 7            # -> loanId
npx priors-v2 repay --all
npx priors-v2 status
npm run quickstart                         # no mainnet? a local v1 chain and the whole flow
```

## Three things not to get wrong

1. **Check the chain and the pool version before claiming anything.** The v2 tools resolve the pool from
   `deployments/<chainId>.v2.json`, the v1 tools from `deployments/<chainId>.json`, and both refuse to guess when
   there is no record for the chain you are pointed at. The v1 record on 4663 is marked `"status": "paused"`:
   new lines and loans there revert. Never invent a pool address, never send an agent to the paused v1 pool,
   and never report an agent as registered when it is not.

2. **Nothing here has had a third-party audit.** v1 shipped with a lender-loss defect the randomized invariants
   did not catch (fixed; `test/DefaultAccounting.t.sol`). v2 had internal adversarial reviews; every finding, fix
   and residual is in `docs/SECURITY-v2.md`, each with a test. ⛔ Do not delete the PoC and regression tests
   (`test/audit-v2/`, `test/audit-final/`, `test/review-v2/`, `test/DefaultAccounting.t.sol`,
   `test_multipleDefaultsKeepLendersWholeWithoutEarnedExposure`) — they are the evidence the fixes work. Do not
   describe any of this as audited or as proven safe.

3. **A default is permanent.** Three days past due and anyone can mark a loan defaulted: the record is
   defaulted forever, the identity can never borrow or back anyone again, the owner's address is marked, and the
   sponsor pays (its shares burnt, or half a staker's seat). Do not borrow for an agent that cannot repay on time.

## Working on the code

```bash
forge test                  # 404 tests, all green (fork-only tests skip)
npm test                    # SDK, CLI, publish guard (needs Foundry)
npm run test:v2             # v2 SDK and x402 client, network-free
npm run devnet              # local v1 chain + deployed pool, bootstrapped so firstLine() works
npm run quickstart          # devnet + the full agent flow
bash scripts/check-public.sh  # fails if any credential reached a tracked file
```

- Solidity 0.8.26, Foundry, `optimizer_runs = 200`; `CreditPoolV2` alone compiles via-IR at `optimizer_runs = 1`
  (a per-file restriction in `foundry.toml`) to fit 24 KB. Contracts are non-upgradeable: a source change only
  reaches users through a new deployment. `src/` for deployed contracts must stay byte-identical to what was
  verified on chain.
- `sdk/priors-v2.mjs` (v2) and `sdk/priors.mjs` (v1) are the contract surfaces (ABIs included);
  `sdk/float.mjs` is the x402 client; `sdk/env.mjs` resolves chain/deployment/signer (`resolveV2()` for v2).
  Use them rather than hand-rolling calls; the 6-decimal conversions, the consent signature and the USDG approval
  are easy to get subtly wrong.
- `scripts/devnet.mjs` must never point at a real chain — it deploys mocks and mints money, and refuses any
  chain that does not answer anvil cheat methods. Keep that refusal.
- Amounts are 6-decimal units on chain and whole dollars in the SDK. Money printed by the CLI is pinned to
  `en-US` so output is the same for everyone.
- Never commit a private key, a `.env`, or a deployment record for a chain you did not deploy to.
