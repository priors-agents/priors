# Check an agent before you deal with it

A free, keyless API on priors.trade that answers one question: what has this agent actually repaid?

Reviews are cheap to fake. This is a record of debt someone else put at risk, and of how it was repaid. Every number below comes from the Priors pool on Robinhood
Chain (chain 4663) and its published score, so anyone can check it against the chain.

## Look up an agent

By its ERC-8004 agent id:

```bash
curl -s "https://priors.trade/api/check?agent=437"
```

By an address, when that is all you have (an x402 `payTo`, a payer, a counterparty's wallet). It finds every agent
that address owns, and every agent that declared it as its payment wallet in the ERC-8004 registry:

```bash
curl -s "https://priors.trade/api/check?address=0x318aE0BDf31bCd3528c34Cb34063b9B537c432D9"
```

No key, no account, CORS open, cached for 30 seconds. Send exactly one of `agent` or `address`.

## What you get back

```json
{
  "query": { "agent": 437 },
  "block": 78097429,
  "verdict": "repaid",
  "agents": [
    {
      "agentId": 437,
      "name": "agent",
      "owner": "0x318ae0bdf31bcd3528c34cb34063b9b537c432d9",
      "matchedAs": ["id"],
      "record": {
        "loansRepaid": 3, "volumeRepaidUsdg": 15, "activeLoans": 0, "defaulted": false, "frozen": false,
        "isRoot": false, "enrolledAt": 1789886352, "lastRepayAt": null, "onchainScore": 24
      },
      "scoreV2": {
        "score": 0, "rung": 0, "rungName": "unproven", "version": "2.0.1", "updatedAt": 1790930430,
        "lateRepayments": 0, "repaidByOthers": 0, "distinctPayers": 0
      },
      "links": { "badge": "https://priors.trade/api/badge/437.svg", "page": "https://priors.trade/agent?id=437" }
    }
  ],
  "attestations": { "chain": "eip155:4663", "registry": "0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63", "attester": "0x613854463bb854225306b9b18bdb451a78430a73", "creditWriter": "0x03af41aeb1eea4da0572bbb6ab1b4c5331f17ac7" }
}
```

- `verdict` is one of `no record`, `defaulted`, `no repayments yet` or `repaid`. An unknown agent or address is
  `no record` with an empty `agents` list (still a 200, so you need no error path for it).
- `matchedAs` says why an agent is listed for an address: `owner`, `declared wallet`, or both.
- `scoreV2` is [Priors Score v2](SCORE-v2.md) (0 to 1000, with its rung). It is `null` while the published scores are
  more than an hour old, never a stale number. `record` is always there.
- `record.onchainScore` is the score the pool computes on chain. Score v2 counts only risk someone else took, so the
  two can differ a lot: the example agent's 3 repaid loans earn it 24 on chain and 0 in v2.
- A default is permanent. An agent with `defaulted: true` never borrows on Priors again.

## A badge for your page or README

```markdown
![Priors record](https://priors.trade/api/badge/437.svg)
```

It shows the score and the loans repaid, turns red on a default, and reads "no record" for an unknown agent. It is
cached for 5 minutes.

## Read it on chain instead

Priors publishes each agent's score to the ERC-8004 reputation registry on Robinhood Chain, from one dedicated attester
address that owns no agent: **`0x613854463BB854225306b9b18bdb451A78430a73`** (also in `attestations.attester`). Anyone
can post feedback with tags that look like ours, so only that address's entries are Priors'. Pass it as
`clientAddresses`:

```solidity
// ReputationRegistry 0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63 on chain 4663
getSummary(agentId, [0x613854463BB854225306b9b18bdb451A78430a73], "priors-score", "")
// returns (count, summaryValue, summaryValueDecimals): count 1, the score (0 to 1000), 0 decimals
```

Each entry is the Priors Score v2 as `value` (0 decimals), `tag1` `priors-score`, `tag2` `rung-<n>/v<weights version>`
(for example `rung-0/v2.0.1`). Since 2026-10-05 (attestation v2) `feedbackURI` is a `data:application/json;base64,`
URI holding the note's own file (the agent's line at a block, its on-time repayments with their transactions, and the
pool's payment to it as `proofOfPayment`) and `feedbackHash` is keccak256 of the file's bytes: see
[ATTESTATION-v2.md](ATTESTATION-v2.md), and check a note from the chain alone with
`node scripts/verify-attestation.mjs <agentId>`. An older entry (a defaulted agent's 0 among them) points at this API's
record of the agent, with `feedbackHash` 0. The attester checks once an hour and posts when an agent first has a score
above 0, when it defaults (value 0), when its rung or the weights version changes, when the score moves by 25 points
or more, when its line opens, closes or moves by a quarter and at least 1 USDG, or when an entry is 30 days old and
the score differs. It revokes
its previous entry first, so there is one live entry per agent and the summary is that score. No entry means no Priors
score yet. The entry can lag the API by up to an hour, and by under 25 points.

### Its loans, as credit statements

The score is Priors' opinion. The loans themselves are posted as ERC-8004 credit statements
([ERC-8004-CREDIT.md](ERC-8004-CREDIT.md)) from a second address that owns no agent and never revokes:
**`0x03af41aEb1EEa4DA0572bbb6AB1B4c5331F17aC7`** (also in `attestations.creditWriter`). Each statement commits to every
loan the agent closed in a block window, chained to the one before; anyone can rebuild it from the pools' own logs:

```bash
node scripts/verify-credit.mjs <agentId> --writer 0x03af41aEb1EEa4DA0572bbb6AB1B4c5331F17aC7 --full \
  --sources docs/erc-8004-credit/priors-manifest.json
```
