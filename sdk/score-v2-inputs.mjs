// Builds Priors Score v2 inputs from public data: the site snapshot (priors.trade/api/snapshot: agents, loans,
// events), known links between agents and wallets (`links`: Priors' clusters list, not published) and x402 income read from the
// chain (sdk/x402-income.mjs: signed USDG payments to agent wallets from any facilitator, the payment wallet each
// agent declared in the ERC-8004 registry, transfers sent back to payers, and who repaid each loan).
// Pure: no network, no clock.
//
// Clusters. A loan counts toward the score only if its backer sits in a different cluster from the borrower, and
// income counts only from payers outside the agent's cluster. An agent's cluster joins its owner, the payment wallet
// it declared (agentWallet: that wallet signed to accept it, so it is under the same control) and every agent and
// wallet linked through them, plus the links of the clusters file. Funding-source clustering (wallets paid for by
// the same source) plugs in here later. Clusters shape the computation only: no output names them.
//
// Income. A payment counts for the agents that declared the paid wallet as their payment wallet (the registry sets
// it to the owner at registration, clears it when the agent changes hands, and changing it needs the wallet's
// signature), shared evenly between them: an agent pushed onto someone's address can't take a share of their income.
// Money an agent's cluster sent to a payer (before or after) is netted out of that payer's payments to it: USDG that
// goes back where it came from is not income. A loan that counts (backed by someone else, repaid on time by the
// agent's own wallets, since its last change of hands) is marked as repaid from income (`incomeShare`, 0..1) by the
// counted income that arrived during it, each payment weighted like income, capped per payer and loan, and spent
// once.
//
// Defaults. A default zeroes the other agents of the wallet that defaulted: the loan's owner when it was taken, and
// the defaulted agent's declared payment wallet. Never whoever holds its NFT today: sending a defaulted agent to
// someone can't harm them.
//
// Fails closed: a backer the snapshot doesn't know, or one enrolled for less than `backers.minAgeDays` when the loan
// was issued, counts as the agent's own money.
//
// Own collateral (weights 2.0.1, `backers.ownCollateralRoots`): the stock vault's root (snapshot meta.stockVaultAgentId)
// counts as the borrower's own money too. The vault backs a line with the borrower's own stock tokens, which it seizes
// on a default: loans on them are no risk someone else took.
