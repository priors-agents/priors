   This used to match a list of ordinary English words - "exceed", "range", "capacity", "unavailable".
   That is a trap, because a contract is free to revert with exactly those: OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 says
   "transfer amount exceeds balance". Such a revert was failed over to every endpoint for the same
   answer and then surfaced as a bare Error. So the test is now structural - the JSON-RPC codes nodes
   actually use to say "not now" - plus a short list of phrases specific enough that no revert reason
   would contain them. Found by review; the suite's revert case used a plain "execution reverted",
   which never collided with the word list.

   providers together and waits for a weighted quorum - a dead first entry there can stall every call
   or fail quorum while a healthy endpoint sits behind it. Priority order is what an operator with a
   private endpoint and a public backstop actually wants.

   The seam is `_send`, not `send`: ethers' own `getNetwork()` reaches the transport through `_send`
   directly, so overriding the higher-level `send` leaves network detection - the very first call -
   pinned to the first endpoint. Found by testing, not by reading.

   A THROWN transport error fails over, and so does a node REFUSING to serve the request - a rate limit,
   or a non-archive node declining a deep `eth_getLogs`. On Robinhood Chain that distinction is not
   academic: of the three public endpoints, two answer a deep log query with HTTP 403 "Archive requests
   require a personal token" and `-32005` "the network is busy". A revert is different: it is the chain's
