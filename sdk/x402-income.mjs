// x402 income from the chain, whoever settled it. An x402 "exact" payment in USDG is an EIP-3009
// transferWithAuthorization: the payer signs, a facilitator submits, and USDG emits AuthorizationUsed(payer, nonce)
// followed by Transfer(payer, payTo, amount) in the same transaction. Reading those two events finds every such
// payment on Robinhood Chain, from any facilitator, not only ours.
//
// Signed USDG payments are common on this chain (apps move large amounts this way), so the scan starts from the
// authorizations (cheap to list) and then asks only for the transfers from those payers to agent wallets.
//
// An x402 payment can also be settled through Permit2 (the "upto" scheme, and "exact" on tokens without EIP-3009):
// Permit2 moves the USDG (one Transfer, no event of its own), then the x402 proxy that called it emits Settled() or
// SettledWithPermit() (x402-foundation/x402, contracts/evm/src/x402UptoPermit2Proxy.sol). Those events are rare, so
// the scan lists them first and asks for the transfers to agent wallets only around them.
//
// Everything here reads public data through a provider (ethers v6) and returns plain objects; the scoring itself is
// sdk/score-v2-inputs.mjs + sdk/score-v2.mjs. Amounts are atomic USDG (6 decimals) as decimal strings.
